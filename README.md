## Preview

Here are some preview images of what the page will look like eventually - however, keep in mind that this project is still undergoing major development (even though I kinda started working on this a long time ago).

## ERD

Also, here is the *Entity Relationship Diagram* of the database behind this project - as exported using *pgAdmin*. I know the lines are a bit fucked up, but I promise that's not my fault - *pgAdmin* was just really messing with me.

**Also ...** I'll probably still change this in the future, as I'm not really happy about many things here, but... I'll stick with it for now :poop:. I mean, I just want to have something that works for now - I can always fix stuff later... right?!
